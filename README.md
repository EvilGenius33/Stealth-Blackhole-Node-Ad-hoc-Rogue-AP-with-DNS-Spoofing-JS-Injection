# Stealth Blackhole Node  
Ad-hoc Rogue AP with DNS Spoofing & JS Injection

## Overview

**Stealth Blackhole Node** is a rogue access point and mesh node simulator designed for red team operations, wireless attack labs, and educational demos.  
It creates an ad-hoc Wi-Fi network (`ibss` mode), integrates with OLSR-based mesh routing, captures HTTP/DNS traffic, spoofs DNS responses, and injects custom JavaScript payloads into intercepted web pages.

Use this tool to simulate real-world wireless MITM attacks and test the resilience of client devices and mesh networks in controlled environments.
